=> What is Docker: Docker is a containerization platform which allow you to package your application along with its dependency into a lightweight portable unit called a container.

=> What is a Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image.
    -> It tells Docker how to create my application image step-by-step.
    -> A Dockerfile is a set of instructions used by Docker to automatically build a Docker image.
    -> Why Do We Need Dockerfile?
        -> Without Dockerfile You manually install Java, copy jar file, set environment and run app.
        -> With docker everything is automated, Reproducible, Version Controlled, Same in Dev, test and Prod
        -> The Dockerfile is kept inside your application project folder, usually at the root level.
        -> Dockerfile itself is not executed like Java code. It is executed by Docker engine.
        -> When you run "docker build -t myapp ."
            -> Docker engine Reads Dockerfile ----> Executes instructions one by one ----> Creates image
        -> Complete Flow:
            -> Developer write the code ------> Adds Dockerfile in root -------> Pushes to Git
            -> CI/CD Pipeline pull code and run command to build image and push to docker hub or ACR(Azure Container Registery)
            -> Kubernetes pulls image from ACR and Runs container
            -> Flow:
                Application Code
                        ↓
                Dockerfile (inside project)
                        ↓
                docker build (runs locally or CI)
                        ↓
                Image Created
                        ↓
                Push to Registry (Docker Hub / ACR)
                        ↓
                Run as Container

=> What is Image: An Image is a blueprint which contains application code, Runtime (Java, Node, Python etc.), Libraries, OS dependencies, Configuration.
    -> You create it using a dockerfile. Example: dockerfile
        FROM openjdk:17
        COPY app.jar app.jar
        ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
    -> When you run docker build -t myapp . This creates an image which is read-only and doesn't run by itself.

=> What is container: A Container is a running instance of an image. Think like Image - class in java, Container - Object created from class
    -> when you run "docker run myapp" Docker creates a container from the image and runs it.
    -> You can start, stop, Delete and scale containers.

=> What is Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a public container registry. It is like GitHub for Docker Images.

=> Azure Container Registry (ACR): Azure Container Registry (ACR) is Microsoft’s private Docker registry service.
    -> It is similar to Docker Hub but private, secure, Integrated with Azure, Used in production environments
    -> Companies prefer ACR instead of Docker Hub because Private images, Enterprise security, Azure Kubernetes Service integration

=> Complete Flow:
    -> Step 1: You write a Dockerfile
    -> Step 2: You build an image: "docker build -t myapp"
    -> Step 3: You push image to a registry(Either push to Docker-Hub "docker push vinay/myapp" or ACR "docker push myacr.azurecr.io/myapp")
    -> Step 4: From anywhere (VM, Kubernetes, Azure), you pull image "docker pull myacr.azurecr.io/myapp"
    -> Step 5: Run container "docker run myapp"
