=> What is Blob Storage: Blob Storage is a type of object storage used to store large amounts of unstructured data such as images, videos, documents, backups, and media files.
                         Blob stands for Binary Large Object, which means data stored in binary form (files).
                         Blob Storage is not a database and not a traditional file system.

=> What kind of data is stored in Blob Storage?
  -> Blob Storage is used to store files, not structured records. Example: Images (jpg, png), Videos (mp4), PDFs, Word, Excel files, Log files, Backups, Static website files
  -> It is not suitable for Tables, Rows and Columns, Transactional Business data

=> How data is organized in Blob Storage
  -> Blob Storage follows a three-level hierarchy: storage account --> Container --> Blob(Files)
  -> Example: company-storage --> invoice_101.pdf --> invoice_102.pdf
      -> Storage Account: Top-level storage resource
      -> Container: Logical grouping of blobs (similar to folder)
      -> Blob: Actual file (image, video, document, etc.)

=> What is Object Storage?
  -> Blob Storage is an example of object storage, where:
    -> Each file is stored as a single object
    -> Objects are accessed using URLs or APIs
    -> There are no real directories like a file system
    -> Each Object contain Data (file content),  Metadata (file info), Unique identifier (blob name / URL)

=> What is Azure Blob Storage?
  -> Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft’s object storage solution for the cloud. It is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. 
  -> Unstructured data is data that does not follow a predefined data model or schema, such as: Text files, Images, Videos, Binary files

=> What is Azure Blob Storage used for?
  -> Azure Blob Storage is designed for the following use cases:
    -> Serving images or documents directly to a browser
    -> Storing files for distributed access
    -> Streaming video and audio content
    -> Writing and storing log files
    -> Backup, restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
    -> Storing data for analysis by on-premises or Azure-hosted services

=> How can Blob Storage be accessed?
  -> Objects stored in Azure Blob Storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world using HTTP or HTTPS. Access methods include:
    -> Azure Storage REST API
    -> Azure PowerShell
    -> Azure CLI
    -> Azure Storage client libraries (Java, .NET, Python, etc.)

=> Types of Azure Storage Accounts
  -> Azure Storage provides two performance levels Storage Accounts:
    -> Standard: This is the default and recommended storage account type for most Azure Storage scenarios.
      -> Uses hard disk drives (HDD)
      -> Cost-effective
      -> Recommended for most use cases
      -> Supported services:
        -> Blob Storage (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2)
        -> Azure Files
        -> Queue Storage
        -> Table Storage
      -> Redundancy options:
        -> LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)
        -> ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)
        -> GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)
        -> RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage)
        -> GZRS (Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage)
        -> RA-GZRS (Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage)
      -> Usage:
        -> Standard storage account for blobs, file shares, queues, and tables
        -> Recommended for most Azure Storage workloads
    -> Premium: Premium Storage Accounts are designed to deliver high performance and low latency by using solid-state drives (SSDs) instead of traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). 
      -> Uses solid-state drives (SSD)
      -> Higher performance and lower latency
      -> Higher cost
      -> Designed for high-performance workloads
      -> Azure provides three types of premium storage accounts, each optimized for a specific storage service and workload.
        -> Premium Block Blobs
          -> Premium Block Blob Storage is optimized for workloads that require high transaction rates, low latency, and frequent access to blob data.
          -> This storage account type is ideal for storing block blobs and append blobs, which are commonly used for files such as images, documents, logs, and analytics data.
          -> It also supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, making it suitable for big data analytics and data processing scenarios.
          -> Supported services: Block blobs, Append Blobs, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
          -> Redundancy Options: 
            -> Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
            -> Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
          -> Typical Use Cases
            -> Applications with high read/write transaction rates
            -> Workloads involving smaller objects accessed frequently
            -> Applications that require consistently low latency
            -> Real-time analytics and streaming ingestion scenarios
        -> Premium File Shares
          -> Premium File Shares Storage is designed to provide high-performance file storage using the Azure Files service.
          -> This storage account type is optimized for enterprise-grade file system workloads, where applications require low-latency access to shared files using standard file system protocols.
          -> It is particularly recommended when Network File System (NFS) support is required in Azure Files.
          -> upported Services: Azure Files only
          -> Redundancy Options
            -> Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
            -> Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
          -> Typical Use Cases
            -> Enterprise applications requiring shared file systems
            -> High-performance file shares for application data
            -> Lift-and-shift workloads migrating on-prem file servers to Azure
            -> Scenarios requiring NFS-based file access
        -> Premium Page Blob Storage Account: 
          -> Premium Page Blob Storage is designed specifically for page blob workloads, which require random read and write operations with very low latency.
          -> Page blobs are primarily used to store virtual hard disk (VHD) files, making this storage account type ideal for Azure virtual machine disks and other disk-based workloads.
          -> Supported Services: Page Blobs only
          -> Redundancy Options
            -> Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
            -> Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
          -> Typical Use Cases
            -> Virtual machine disks
            -> High-performance random I/O workloads
            -> Scenarios requiring frequent updates to specific ranges within a file

=> Types of Redundancy in Azure
  -> LRS – Locally Redundant Storage: It means 3 copies of data stored in the same data centre within the same region.
  -> ZRS – Zone-Redundant Storage: It means 3 copies of data stored across different availability zones within the same region.
  -> GRS – Geo-Redundant Storage: It means 3 copies of data stored in the primary region and 3 copies of data stored in a paired secondary region (different region).
  -> RA-GRS – Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage: It means you can read data from the secondary region even when the primary region is healthy. Used when global read access is required.
  -> GZRS – Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage: It means ZRS in the primary region and GRS replication to a secondary region.
  -> RA-GZRS – Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage: It means GZRS with read access enabled for the secondary region. Provides the highest availability and has the highest cost.
