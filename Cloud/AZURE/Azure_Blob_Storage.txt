=> What is Blob Storage: Blob Storage is a type of object storage used to store large amounts of unstructured data such as images, videos, documents, backups, and media files.
                         Blob stands for Binary Large Object, which means data stored in binary form (files).
                         Blob Storage is not a database and not a traditional file system.

=> What kind of data is stored in Blob Storage?
  -> Blob Storage is used to store files, not structured records. Example: Images (jpg, png), Videos (mp4), PDFs, Word, Excel files, Log files, Backups, Static website files
  -> It is not suitable for Tables, Rows and Columns, Transactional Business data

=> How data is organized in Blob Storage
  -> Blob Storage follows a three-level hierarchy: storage account --> Container --> Blob(Files)
  -> Example: company-storage --> invoice_101.pdf --> invoice_102.pdf
      -> Storage Account: Top-level storage resource
      -> Container: Logical grouping of blobs (similar to folder)
      -> Blob: Actual file (image, video, document, etc.)

=> What is Object Storage?
  -> Blob Storage is an example of object storage, where:
    -> Each file is stored as a single object
    -> Objects are accessed using URLs or APIs
    -> There are no real directories like a file system
    -> Each Object contain Data (file content),  Metadata (file info), Unique identifier (blob name / URL)

=> SMB (Server Message Block) vs NFS (Network File System)
  -> SMB (Server Message Block)
    -> A network file sharing protocol mainly used by Windows systems.
    -> Allows applications to read, write, create, and delete files on a remote server as if they are local.
    -> Supports file locking, authentication, and permissions.
    -> Commonly used for shared folders and network drives.
    -> In Azure Files, SMB is used to mount file shares on Windows, Linux, macOS.
    -> Example: Mapping a network drive like Z: in Windows.
  -> NFS (Network File System)
    -> A network file sharing protocol mainly used by Linux and Unix systems.
    -> Allows multiple machines to access shared files over a network.
    -> Designed for high performance and scalability in Linux environments.
    -> Uses a stateless or lightweight state model depending on version.
    -> In Azure Files, NFS is used to mount file shares on Linux systems.
    -> Example: Mounting a shared directory like /mnt/shared.

=> What is Azure Blob Storage?
  -> Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft’s object storage solution for the cloud. It is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. 
  -> Unstructured data is data that does not follow a predefined data model or schema, such as: Text files, Images, Videos, Binary files

=> What is Azure Blob Storage used for?
  -> Azure Blob Storage is designed for the following use cases:
    -> Serving images or documents directly to a browser
    -> Storing files for distributed access
    -> Streaming video and audio content
    -> Writing and storing log files
    -> Backup, restore, disaster recovery, and archiving
    -> Storing data for analysis by on-premises or Azure-hosted services

=> How can Blob Storage be accessed?
  -> Objects stored in Azure Blob Storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world using HTTP or HTTPS. Access methods include:
    -> Azure Storage REST API
    -> Azure PowerShell
    -> Azure CLI
    -> Azure Storage client libraries (Java, .NET, Python, etc.)

=> Storage Tier: Storage tier defines the cost and access characteristics of data based on how frequently it is accessed. There are basically 3 types pf tier:
  -> Hot Tier:
    -> Used for data that is accessed frequently.
    -> Has the highest storage cost but the lowest access cost.
    -> Suitable for active data like images, videos, or files used by applications.
  -> Cool Tier:
    -> Used for data that is accessed infrequently (at least once in 30 days)
    -> Has lower storage cost than Hot tier but higher access cost.
    -> Suitable for backups, older documents, or infrequently used data.
  -> Archive Tier:
    -> Used for data that is rarely accessed (long-term storage).
    -> Has the lowest storage cost but the highest access cost and retrieval latency.
    -> Data must be rehydrated before access.
    -> Suitable for compliance data, long-term backups, and archival records.
  Storage tiers apply only to Standard storage accounts(only in Blob Storage not in Azure Files, Queue Storage, or Table Storage), while Premium storage accounts always provide high performance and do not support Hot, Cool, or Archive tiers.

=> Types of Azure Storage Accounts
  -> Azure Storage provides two performance levels Storage Accounts:
    -> Standard: This is the default and recommended storage account type for most Azure Storage scenarios.
      -> Uses hard disk drives (HDD)
      -> Cost-effective
      -> Recommended for most use cases
      -> Supported services:
        -> Blob Storage (including Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2):
          -> It support storage tier: Hot, Cool and Archive

          -> Files are stored as objects (blobs) inside containers.
          -> Accessed and uploaded using URL / REST API / SDKs.
          -> Not mounted like a traditional file system.
          -> Optimized for high throughput and scalability.
          -> Example: images, videos, PDFs, backups, logs, big data files.
        -> Azure Files
          -> Provides fully managed file shares in the cloud.
          -> Supports standard file system access using SMB and NFS protocols.
          -> Used when applications need shared file access, similar to a network file system.
          -> This is file system storage, access like a network drive. 
          -> Can be mounted on Windows, Linux, or macOS machines.
          -> You can mount it locally using PowerShell or shell script, and it appears as a new drive.
          -> Any upload, delete, or update reflects immediately in the Azure portal.
          -> Example: shared application files, configuration files, lift-and-shift file servers.
        -> Queue Storage
          -> Used for storing small pieces of data called messages.
          -> Designed for scalable and asynchronous communication between application components.
          -> Helps decouple different parts of an application.
          -> Examples: background job processing, task queues, message buffering.
        -> Table Storage
          -> Stores semi-structured data in the form of key-value pairs.
          -> Data is stored in tables, but there is no relationship between tables.
          -> Data is accessed using Partition Key and Row Key.
          -> Designed for fast access to large amounts of structured or semi-structured data.
          -> Examples: user profiles, metadata storage, configuration data.
